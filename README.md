n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a [fair-code](http://faircode.io) distribution model, n8n will
always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and
apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.
